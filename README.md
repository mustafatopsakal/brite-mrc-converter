# BRITE to MRC Converter

This tool is used to convert topologies generated by the [BRITE (Boston University Representative Internet Topology Generator)](https://www.cs.bu.edu/brite/) tool into inputs compatible with the [Multiple Routing Configurations (MRC)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220429606_Multiple_Routing_Configurations_for_Fast_IP_Network_Recovery) algorithm.

## Description

The BRITE to MRC Converter takes network topologies created with the BRITE tool and transforms them into a format that can be used with the MRC algorithm.
